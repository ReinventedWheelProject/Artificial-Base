#From Birth to 3 Months

The first three months of a child's life are a time of wonder. Major developmental milestones at this age are centered on exploring the basic senses and learning more about the body and the environment. During this period, most infants begin to:

    See objects more clearly within a distance of 13 inches
    Focus on moving objects, including the faces of caregivers
    Tell between sweet, salty, bitter and sour tastes
    Detect differences in pitch and volume
    See all colors in the human visual spectrum
    Respond to their environment with facial expressions

    Demonstrate anticipatory behaviors like rooting and sucking at the site of a nipple or bottle

#From 3 to 6 Months
In early infancy, perceptual abilities are still developing. From the age of three to six months, infants begin to develop a stronger sense of perception. At this age, most babies begin to:

    Recognize familiar faces

    Respond to the facial expressions of other people
    Recognize and react to familiar sounds
    Begin to imitate facial expressions

#From 6 to 9 Months

Looking inside the mind of an infant is no easy task. After all, researchers cannot just ask a baby what he or she is thinking at any given moment. To learn more about the mental processes of infants, researchers have come up with a number of creative tasks that reveal the inner workings of the baby brain. From the age of six to nine months, researchers have found that most infants begin to:

    Understand the differences between animate and inanimate objects
    Tell the differences between pictures depicting different numbers of objects
    Utilize the relative size of an object to determine how far away it is
    Gaze longer at "impossible" things, such as an object suspended in midair

#From 9 to 12 Months

As infants become more physically adept, they are able to explore the world around them in greater depth. Sitting up, crawling, and walking are just a few of the physical milestones that allow babies to gain a greater mental understanding of the world around them. As they approach one year of age, most infants are able to:

    Understand the concept of object permanence, the idea that an object continues to exist even though it cannot be seen
    Imitate gestures and some basic actions
    Respond with gestures and sounds
    Like looking at picture books
    Manipulate objects by turning them over, trying to put one object into another, etc. 

#From 1 Year to 2 Years

After reaching a year of age, children's physical, social, and cognitive development seems to grow by leaps and bounds. Children at this age spend a tremendous amount of time observing the actions of adults, so it is important for parents and caregivers to set good examples for behavior. Most one-year-olds begin to:

    Understand and respond to words
    Identify objects that are similar
    Tell the difference between "Me" and "You"
    Imitate the actions and language of adults
    Can point out familiar objects and people in a picture book
    Learn through exploration 

#From 2 to 3 Years

At two years of age, children are becoming increasingly independent. Since they are now able to better explore the world, a great deal of learning during this stage is the result of their own experiences. Most two-year-olds are able to:

    Sort objects by category (i.e., animals, flowers, trees, etc.)
    Stack rings on a peg from largest to smallest
    Imitate more complex adult actions (playing house, pretending to do laundry, etc.)
    Identify their own reflection in the mirror by name
    Respond to simple directions from parents and caregivers
    Name objects in a picture book
    Match objects with their uses

#From 3 to 4 Years

Children become increasingly capable of analyzing the world around them in more complex ways. As they observe things, they begin to sort and categorize them into different categories, often referred to as schemas. Since children are becoming much more active in the learning process, they also begin to pose questions about the world around them. "Why?" becomes a very common question around this age. At the age of three, most kids are able to:

    Demonstrate awareness of the past and present
    Actively seek answers to questions
    Learn by observing and listening to instructions
    Organize objects by size and shape
    Understand how to group and match object according to color
    Have a longer attention span of around 5 to 15 minutes
    Asks "why" questions to gain information

#From 4 to 5 Years

As they near school age, children become better at using words, imitating adult actions, counting and other basic activities that are important for school preparedness. Most four-year-olds are able to:

    Rhyme
    Name and identify many colors
    Draw the shape of a person
    Count to five
    Tell where they live
    Draw pictures that they often name and describe
